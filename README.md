# CubeFitter

[![Build Status](https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

## Introduction

A package for automatically fitting emission lines in astronomical spectral cubes.
Hopefully, this could develop into a more general package for handling spectral cubes in
Julia.

Development is still in early days, so everything may break - but currently, the NIRSpec
related code _Works For Meâ„¢_. I am in the process of testing it for MIRI and MUSE, and
most other instruments should be quite easy to add as well.


## What does it do (and how)?

This code contains three main components (which may get separated into
their own packages later): 

- A family of `SpectralCube` types which handle the data and metadata.
- A continuum subtraction function (see description below)
- The functionality for fitting emission lines.

The workhorses of this package are the various types `NIRSpecCube`, `MUSECube`,
etc.; as well as the functions `cont_subt()`, `fit_cube()`, and
`fit_spectrum_from_subcube()`.


## Usage

### Installing

This package is not yet registered to install through the Julia package manager
(maybe later). You can install the GitHub `main` branch by running:

```julia 
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl")
```


### Quick example

A simple example of a session using `CubeFitter.jl`:

```julia
julia> cube = NIRSpecCube("/path/to/datacube.fits", "g140m"; z_init=2.43)
julia> cscube = cont_subt(cube)
julia> write_spectral_cube_to_fits("mycube.fits", cscube)
julia> out = fit_cube(cscube)
julia> write_maps_to_fits("/desired/path/to/output/file.fits", out)
```

It is of course possible to just load the continuum subtracted cube and not go
through that step again. 

The function `fit_cube()` will return a dictionary of $N\times M \times 3$ arrays, one for
each fitted line, as well as one for the 0th to 2nd moment, the spaxel-wise redshift, and
line width. Each such array will have the measured values as the first slice, the
parameter error in the second slice, and the fit statistics in the last. Each of these
slices will be saved as an individual HDU in the output FITS file.

The function `fit_cube` is mainly a convenience function enabling one to cycle through every
spaxel in the cube, and running the fits with default settings. One can also use the
function `fit_spectrum_from_subcube()` directly. This function allows to extract a
spectrum from the cube based on an x- and y range passed to it (this must always be a
range; if only one spaxel is wanted, give the range for the spaxel (_i_, _j_) as
`xrange=i:i, yrange=j:j`). The function extracts a simple, un-weighted spectrum over the
given (_x, y_) range, runs the fit, and return a dictionary of the fit results and
statistics, along with the extracted spectrum, errors, and wavelength range for
convenience. See the function docstring to learn more.


### Specify lines to fit

If nothing is specified in the call to `fit_cube` or
`fit_spectrum_from_subcube`, these functions will attempt to fit all lines in
the line list loaded along with the datacube, but will skip any that either is
outside the wavelength range of the cube, or has flux below the value of `min_snr`.

It is also possible to specify a list of lines to fit at the time of calling
these functions, with the optional argument `line_selection`, taking a list of
line names in String of Symbol format.

If no kinematic template lines are selected (see below), the lines in this list
will be fitted simultaneously with shared kinematic parameters.

If kinematic template lines are specified, then the remaining lines will be
modeled one by one.


### Use selection of lines as kinematics template

the `fit_cube` function can as an optional argument take a list of lines to use
for a kinematics template. In this case, the lines of this list will first be
fit simultaneously as above. Afterwards, the remaining lines will be fit one by
one with their kinematics fixed to the one found from the template lines, and
the flux left as the only free parameters. 

```julia
julia> cscube = NIRSpecCube("/path/to/cont_subtracted/datacube.fits", "g140m"; z_init=0.76)
julia> out = fit_cube(cscube, kinematics_from_lines=[:HI_4861, :OIII_4959, :OIII_5007])
julia> quicklook_slice(out, :OIII_5007, norm=sqrt, cmap=:inferno)
```

**NB!** Lines that are part of blended features should be included in this list
to be modeled properly, even if they are not particularly strong. I will
implement something more elegant if I find the time (pull requests are always welcome!) 


### Data format

The function `fit_cube()` expects the data to already be continuum subtracted, but
otherwise saved in the same data format as the final pipeline products of a given
instrument; this can be done using the `cont_subt()` function as described above. Using
JWST/NIRSpec as an example, this means that the data cubes should be saved as a FITS file
with an empty primary HDU, and the flux and error cubes saved as the first and second
extensions, respectively. At the moment, this requirement is hardcoded, and any other
formats will either throw an error or, at worst, yield wrong and meaningless results.

### Quicklook functions

`CubeFitter` includes three functions to quickly view fitting output for quality
control. See the docstings in the Julia REPL for documentation. The functions are:

- **`quicklook_slice`**: Views the 2D line and kinematics maps output by `fit_cube`.

- **`quicklook_fit_result_dict`**: Previews the output of a single spectrum fit
  generated by `fit_spectrum_from_subcube`.


- **`quicklook_model`**: Previews a model generated by the function
  `build_model`. See the docstrings of these functions for directions.

# Developing

To hack on your own branch, clone the repository to your preferred location;
then activate it. It is a good idea to use `Revise.jl` to have changes
impolemented and precompiled on-the-go: 

```julia
julia> using Revise   # Optional but a good idea
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate("/path/to/CubeFitter.jl")
julia> Pkg.instantiate()  # Install dependencies, needs only be done once.
julia> using CubeFitter
```

Alternatively, you can enter the `Pkg>` prompt, run `activate /path/to/CubeFitter.jl`,
then (first time) `instantiate()`. Press Backspace to return to the normal `julia>`
prompt, and run `using CubeFitter`.

## Planned features / whishlist

In order of approximate priority: 

- [x] Include continuum subtraction functionality in the package.
- [x] Make it possible to add a second and perhaps third kinematic component. 
- [x] Write quicklook-functions allowing to quickly view the fit outputs with minimum
      input. But still be tinker-friendly, don't hide stuff from the user.
- [ ] Spectrum extraction and fitting from arbitrary masks, e.g. fragmentation maps.
- [ ] Implement adaptive binning.
- [ ] Allow user to fix ratio between lines of doublets with shared
      upper levels.
- [ ] Create interface to select lines to always fit together (useful for
      blended features).
- [ ] Test and ensure the `MUSECube` and `MIRICube` structs actually work as advertised
- [ ] Allow to measure flux/upper limits numerically when S/N threshold is not met.
- [ ] Add support for more instruments. Suggestions welcome (especially if accompanied
      with a suitable test dataset).


# Other projects

- [`Loki.jl`](https://github.com/Michael-Reefe/Loki.jl) is another (and way
  more advanced and ambitious) Julia package for IFU data than this one. Loki
  seems to implement much more astrophysics and much more complex models than
  the simple non-parametric continuum subtraction and Gaussian peaks of
  CubeFitter. On the other hand, with the higher specialization also comes a
  more limited scope in terms of which targets you could apply it on; and I
  find that CubeFitter is simpler to use for its different scope. CubeFitter
  also is written in pure Julia and does not depend on any Python packages
  through `PyCall`. 

  If you want to implement physical per-spaxel dust models, PAH features and
  stellar kinematics in your model, then Loki is probably what you want. If on
  the other hand, you are simply looking for a 1- or 2-Gaussian component model
  of your lines with shared kinematics by default, CubeFitter might be right
  for you.
