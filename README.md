# CubeFitter

[![Build Status](https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

## Introduction

A package for automatically fitting emission lines in astronomical spectral cubes.
Hopefully, this could develop into a more general package for handling spectral cubes in
Julia.

Development is still in early days, so everything may break - but the NIRSpec related code
Works For Meâ„¢.

Better README to come.

## Enabling the package

This package is not yet registered to install (maybe later). To run it now, clone the
repository to your preferred location; then:

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> activate /path/to/CubeFitter.jl
julia> using CubeFitter
```

## Example usage

## Screens

There really isn't much to look at but here it is:
