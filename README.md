# CubeFitter

[![Build Status](https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/thriveth/CubeFitter.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A package for automatically fitting emission lines in astronomical
spectral cubes. Hopefully, this could develop into a more general
package for handling spectral cubes in Julia. 

Development is still in early days, so everything may break - but the
NIRSpec related code Works For Meâ„¢.

Better README to come.
